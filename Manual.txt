			       Programming guide


Overview:
SuperFill  is an Activex designed for Visual Basic 6.0. It let to fill polygon with solid colors or user patterns.
It can replace the Polygon API that with some printers does not work correctly. 
The control have only a method and 4 properties. SuperFill method perform the polygon fill of a polygon passed how parameter. with the properties can be set the style.


Property:

Fillmode 
""""""""
(Integer) says to the control if filling will be performed on a form, picturebox or printer objects, or if the scanlines must be returned to an array 

0 - (default)  Ouput to an object specified in the property Dest on SuperFill method
1 - Load and return an array of points.

also view: Array structure


FillColor
"""""""""
Fill Color (Long)

FillPattern
"""""""""""
(String)  Name of file *.mtp tath identify the pattern. If this property is empty will be used the solid fill

Also view: Pattern structure and scale


FillScale
"""""""""
(Single) Scale of filling (0 of solid fill)

  
Method:

  SuperFill Dest, EdgeX, EdgeY, nVertex, RetArray, nProins
  """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" 
Parameter  	Type    Description  
Dest      	Object  PictureBox, Form, Printer
EdgeX		Double	X Array of  polygon vertex
EdgeY		Double	Y Array of  polygon vertex
nVertex		Integer	Number of vertex of polygon
RetArray	Double	Array Double returned with the scanlines
nPoints		Long	Number of points returned (1 line = 4 elements, x1,y1,x2,y2)



Remarks:
""""""""
- The array will be returned only with FillMode=1
- Both FillMode=1 and =0 require object Dest 
- RetArray And nPoints MUST BE declared and cannot ever omitted

Dim RetArray() as Double, nPoints as Long




Array Structure:
""""""""""""""""
For a filling Off-Line, the control can returned an array of points that contain all scan-lines   

for each line, starting and final coordinate (x1,y1,x2,y2) are stored sequentially into the array monodimensional. So, first 4 elements describe the first line, other 4 second line and so on.

RetArray(1)=   X 1° vertex
RetArray(2)=   Y 1° vertex
RetArray(3)=   X 2° vertex
RetArray(4)=   Y 2° vertex

RetArray(5)=   X 1° vertex
RetArray(6)=   Y 1° vertex
RetArray(7)=   X 2° vertex
RetArray(8)=   Y 2° vertex
..
..


nPoints will be always multiple of 4



Pattern Structure and scale:
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The pattern is a simple file ASCII that contain all coord of filling lines
This structure show how fill with regular squares.

** squares
0.0878;0.9962;0.0878;0.0679
0.0878;0.0679;0.9977;0.0679
0.9977;0.0679;0.9977;0.9992
0.8969;0.9992;0.0847;0.9992

First line must have two ** and optional a brief description 
next lines specify 4 coord. of a graphic line. x1;y1;x2;y2

Each pattern correspond to  an area of dimension 1x1. Setting Fillscale Property to enlarge or reduce the ratio according with polygon.
  
for example, for a polygon of extent xmax=100 and ymax=100 will need to set the scale = 30 so that process filling resulting correctly. 



Tips for programming.
"""""""""""""""""""""
Since you can use this control to filling directly your polygon, is strongly reccomended you fill your arrays of lines with the result array of control. Filling directly a polygon means recalculate all data each refresh of your draw. This can produce short performance.
